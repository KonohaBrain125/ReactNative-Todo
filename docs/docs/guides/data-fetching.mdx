# Data Fetching

From the beginning of React, tha community has been building a rich ecosystem of tools and libraries that help you build your applications. One of the most important parts of this ecosystem is the ability to fetch data from a server and display it in your application.

There are many ways to fetch data for react and react native apps nowadays but in the last few years, the community has been moving towards using react-query as a default solution to fetch data as it comes with many features every app needs out of the box and the fact that it is very easy and simple to use.

## What is react-query?

[React-query](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/overview) It is a very powerful library that helps you manage your data fetching, caching, invalidating, and even implement optimistic UI in a very simple way.

react-query provides a set of hooks to query and mutate data in your app. and give you the ability to create your own custom hooks based on `useQuery` and `useMutation` hooks.

## Using react-query

The starter comes with react-query installed and configured with axios as the default client to save you time and effort.

All fetching logic is located in the `src/api` folder. You can find a `common` folder which contains the `client`, `queryClient` and a set of utility functions to help you work with react-query.

As we are using axios as client, we can benefit from the axios features like interceptors, request cancellation, and many more. You can find more information about axios[here](https://axios-http.com/).

## Fetching Data with react-query

Lets imagine you are building a blog app and you need to implement the following features:

- A Feed Screen to list all posts
- A Post Screen to show the details of a post
- A Screen to create a new post

Before we start, lets create a new folder called `posts` inside `src/api`, this folder will contain all the logic related to posts. You can think the same way about users or any other entity in your app.

### The Feed Screen

The feed screen will list all posts in the app. We will create the `usePosts` hook to fetch the posts and display them in a list.

1. Create a new file called `use-posts.ts` inside `src/api/posts`
2. Create a type for your Response and Params if needed to make sure that you are getting the right data from the server.(eg. `Post` type)
3. Create a function that return a `Promise` and will be used to fetch the data from the server. This function will be called by react-query to fetch the data.(eg. `getPosts` function)
4. Finally, you need to create a custom hook that will use the `useQuery` hook from react-query to fetch the data and return it. (eg. `usePosts` hook)

Here is the complete code for the `use-posts.ts` file:

<CodeBlock title="src/api/posts/use-posts.ts" language="tsx">
  {UsePosts}
</CodeBlock>

5. Now that we have our custom hook ready we can use it in our app. Lets create a new screen called `Posts` and use data from `usePosts` hook to display a list of posts:

<CodeBlock title="src/screens/feed/list.tsx" language="tsx">
  {Feed}
</CodeBlock>

As you can see in the code above we are using the `usePosts` that provide us with data and loading state to display a loading indicator while the data is being fetched and then display the list of posts.

### The Post Screen

The post screen will show the details of a post. We will create the `usePost` hook to fetch the post and display it.

We are going to use the same steps as we did in the previous section to create the `usePost` hook. The only difference is that we will use the `id` as a parameter to fetch the post.

Here is the complete code for the `use-post.ts` file:

<CodeBlock title="src/api/posts/use-post.ts" language="tsx">
  {UsePost}
</CodeBlock>

Now our hook is ready to be used in our post details screen:

<CodeBlock title="src/screens/feed/post.tsx" language="tsx">
  {Post}
</CodeBlock>

### Creating a new post

To implement the create post feature we will need to use the `useMutation` hook from react-query following the steps below:

1. Create a new file called `add-post.ts` inside `src/api/posts`
2. Create a type mutation input and response to make sure that you are sending the right data to the server.( `Input` type)
3. Create a function that take our input as params and return a `Promise` and will be used to send the data to the server. This function will be called by react-query to send the data.( `addPost` function)
4. Now that we have our mutation function ready we can create a custom hook that will use the `useMutation` hook from react-query to send the input data and return the result. ( `useAddPost` hook)

Here is the complete code for the `add-post.ts` file:

<CodeBlock title="src/api/posts/add-post.ts" language="tsx">
  {UseAddPost}
</CodeBlock>

Now that we have our mutation hook ready. Lets create a new screen called `AddPost` and use data from `useAddPost` hook to create a new post:

Exactly the same way we did in [form section](../ui-and-theme/Forms.mdx) while creating a login form, we will follow the same approach to create a from to create a new post.

1. Create the schema for the new form using zod
2. Create the form using react-hook-form
3. Get `mutate` function from `useAddPost` hook and call on handleSubmit

<CodeBlock title="src/screens/feed/add-post.tsx" language="tsx">
  {AddPost}
</CodeBlock>
