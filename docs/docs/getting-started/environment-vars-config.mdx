# Environment variable and configuration

We opted to use a simple typescript file to store all the environment variables and configuration for a simple reason, adding typechecking for the environment variables to make sure we are not missing any required variables using the correct type for each variable.

Using a simple typescript file for environment variables help us keep the project simple as possible as we didn't need to add any extra dependencies to the project.

## Adding environment variables

The environment variables file is located at `src/config` and it's support multiple app variant such as `development`, `staging` and `production`.

<CodeBlock title="config/config.js" language="js">
  {ConfigJs}
</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock title="config/index.ts" language="ts">
  {ConfigTs}
</CodeBlock>

:::note
We need only the ts file configuration file but as we can't import typescript files in expo config file. we need to create a js file that will export the same configuration as the ts file.

## Using environment variables

As we are using an absolute import for the configuration file, you can easily import environment variables in any file in the project.

<CodeBlock title="api/common/client.tsx" language="ts">
  {APICommons}
</CodeBlock>
